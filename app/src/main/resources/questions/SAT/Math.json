To maximize 'a', we should minimize 'b' while satisfying a+b >= 10. The smallest 'b' can be is when we try to take as many 'a' as possible. If b = 10-a (to meet exactly 10 packages), then 120a + 100(10 - a) ≤ 1100. 120a + 1000 - 100a ≤ 1100. 20a + 1000 ≤ 1100. 20a ≤ 100. a ≤ 5. So the maximum number of 120-pound packages is 5. At a=5, b must be at least 5 (so 5+5=10 packages). Weight: 5*120 + 5*100 = 600 + 500 = 1100 lbs. This meets all conditions.",
      "If 6 (120lb) packages (720 lbs), then at least 4 (100lb) packages (400 lbs) must be carried for a total of 10 packages. Total weight: 720+400=1120 lbs, which is > 1100. So 6 is not possible."

      "Let x be the number of 120-pound packages and y be the number of 100-pound packages. Set up a system of two linear inequalities based on the total number of packages and the total weight. To maximize x, try to minimize y while satisfying the constraints."
